## Python
### ðŸš€ Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

**Code:** [`Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering`](https://github.com/lekhakasinadhuni07/Customer-Segmentation-K-Means-Clustering)

### âœ” Key Findings:

- **Customer Segments Identified**

   - Cluster 1 - High Income, High Spending (Premium Shoppers)
   - Cluster 2 - High Income, Low Spending (Cautious Spenders)
   - Cluster 3 - Low Income, High Spending (Impulse Buyers)
   - Cluster 4 - Low Income, Low Spending (Minimal Shoppers)
 
- **Optimal Number of Clusters (K) Selection**
Used the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of clusters. The optimal K value was found to be 4, balancing interpretability and model efficiency.

- **Visual Representation of Clusters:**
Data was visualized using scatter plots to clearly distinguish customer segments. Color-coded clustering helped in understanding spending patterns at a glance.

### âœ” Business Impact & Recommendations:

- **Revenue Growth:** Identify high-value customers to maximize sales and profitability.
- **Targeted Promotions:** Engage premium shoppers with exclusive offers and impulse buyers with discounts.
- **Customer Retention:** Use loyalty programs to encourage cautious spenders to increase spending.
- **Sales Forecasting:** Leverage customer behavior insights for accurate revenue predictions and inventory management.
