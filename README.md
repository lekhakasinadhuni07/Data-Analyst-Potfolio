### Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

**Code:** [`Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering`](https://github.com/lekhakasinadhuni07/Customer-Segmentation-K-Means-Clustering)

### ✔ Key Findings:

**1. Customer Segments Identified**

- Cluster 1 - High Income, High Spending (Premium Shoppers)
- Cluster 2 - High Income, Low Spending (Cautious Spenders)
- Cluster 3 - Low Income, High Spending (Impulse Buyers)
- Cluster 4 - Low Income, Low Spending (Minimal Shoppers)
 
**2. Optimal Number of Clusters (K) Selection**
Used the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of clusters. The optimal K value was found to be 4, balancing interpretability and model efficiency.

**3. Visual Representation of Clusters:**
Data was visualized using scatter plots to clearly distinguish customer segments. Color-coded clustering helped in understanding spending patterns at a glance.

### ✔ Business Impact & Recommendations:

- Revenue Growth: Identify high-value customers to maximize sales and profitability.
- Targeted Promotions: Engage premium shoppers with exclusive offers and impulse buyers with discounts.
- Customer Retention: Use loyalty programs to encourage cautious spenders to increase spending.
- Sales Forecasting: Leverage customer behavior insights for accurate revenue predictions and inventory management.
